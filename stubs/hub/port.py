"""The ``port`` module contains constants that enable easy addressing of the
lettered ports on the SPIKE Prime hub. Use the constants in all functions that
take a ``port`` parameter.

To use the ``port`` module add the following import statement to your
project:

::

    from hub import port

All constants in the module should be called inside the ``port`` module
as a prefix like so:

::

    port.A

The following constants are defined:

* ``A`` = 0
* ``B`` = 1
* ``C`` = 2
* ``D`` = 3
* ``E`` = 4
* ``F`` = 5
"""

A = 0
B = 1
C = 2
D = 3
E = 4
F = 5
