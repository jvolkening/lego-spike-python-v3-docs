"""The ``light_matrix`` module includes functions to interact with the 5x5 LED
matrix on the face of the SPIKE hubs.

To use the ``light_matrix`` module, add the following import statement to
your project:

::

    from hub import light_matrix

All functions in the module should be called inside the ``light_matrix``
module as a prefix like so:

::

    light_matrix.write("Hello World")

* ``IMAGE_HEART`` = 1
* ``IMAGE_HEART_SMALL`` = 2
