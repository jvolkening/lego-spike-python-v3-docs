LEGO Spike Python API v3
============================================

This documentation of the LEGO Spike API (v3) for Python was autogenerated
from a set of module stubs, which were themselves generated from parsing of
the official LEGO help documents at
`<https://spike.legoeducation.com/prime/help/lls-help-python>`_. Thus, while
they should be generally correct and complete, some errors or omissions may
exist. Please report any issues to the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/jvolkening/lego-spike-python-v3-docs>`_.
